# My dotfiles.

Welcome to my dotfiles I use on my Arch Linux laptop.

These might be a bit messy. I try to keep them tidy, but my laziness sometimes gets the better of me. Also, some of these configs and scripts are personalized for myself, and might not be useful for anyone else.

The file structure of this repo is not accurate, so don't try to copy everything directly to your home folder.

## My Inspirations

- **Metamist**: His [r/unixporn post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/73t6k3/i3gaps_firewatch/]) caught my eye and I initially used [his dotfiles](https://github.com/Metamist/dotfiles). My rice dotfiles are still based off his dotfiles.

- **Luke Smith**: His ricing videos on his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) gave me many ideas to add to my own rice.

## Configs present here
- i3 (i3-gaps-next-git) (windows manager)

- rofi (application launcher, window switcher, etcl)
