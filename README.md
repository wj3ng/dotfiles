# My dotfiles.

Welcome to my dotfiles I use on my Arch Linux laptop.

These might be a bit messy. I try to keep them tidy, but my laziness sometimes gets the better of me.

## Configs present here
- i3 (i3-gaps-next-git) (windows manager)
- vim (text editor)
- ranger (file manager)
	- file icons
- neofetch (displays system information)
- dunst (notifications)
- rofi (application launcher, window switcher, etcl)
- cava (audio visualizer)
- termite (terminal emulator)

## Other programs I use
Programs I use that I didn't configure. Obviously not all of them, just the ones I thought was worth mentioning.
- Google Chrome (web browser)
- Spotify (music streaming)
- Atom (GUI text editor)
- VLC (media player)
- ibus (Chinese input)
- scrot (screenshots)
- nitrogen (wallpaper manager)
- feh (image viewer)
- colorls (prettier ls)
- bash-pipes (terminal screensaver, just looks cool)

## Screenshots
Coming soon TM.

## Dependencies and fonts
- w3m (display images in terminal, used in ranger)
- playerctl (music controller)
- Nerd Fonts (for polybar and ranger icons)
